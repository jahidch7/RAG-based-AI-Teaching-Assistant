Media in HTML", "start": 885.48, "end": 887.48, "text": " music"}], "text": " In today's video, we will learn how audio, video and media elements are used in HTML. In our very first video, we saw that we can embed videos in HTML. Today I will tell you how the video is auto-played, how to keep a muted video, and how you can enable and disable the video controls. Along with that, we will also see very closely about audio, how media can be shown in an overall page. So do like this video and stay in this video because the examples I have used for video tags are very amazing. Let's go to the video screen. Let's roll the intro. Intro Friends, this time I have made a folder named video10. I will not waste your time by opening the open with code by right-clicking and shifting. In fact, I will make it in index.html. And the topic of today's video is video. How to play a video, how to put a video in an HTML file, how to put audio, how to put media. So adding a video is very straightforward. I will copy it here, which is our video tag. It has an src attribute and it has some other attributes about which I will discuss with you. But first of all, I want to tell you here that video src is equal to you will write here, so if you have video.mp4, it will play. I have video.mp4. So let's see here, I have put it here with ctrl. And I will click here and preview it. And you can see here that this video has come. Now it is a very big video. So what can I do? I can give its width. So I can say here width is equal to 555 pixels. And as soon as I do 555 pixels, in fact, I don't need to write px. I will only do 555. Like we don't need to write px in the image. We don't need to write px here either. So as soon as I did width is equal to 555, in fact, I do one thing. I do height is equal to 555 so that it becomes smaller. In fact, I make it smaller. I do 255. And you see it came here. Okay? Now I play it because I have clicked ctrl. I can play it. Look here, there is a better road than America. What's your name? Gopindra Jogi. Where did you go in the US? I have gone to many places in the US. Tell me your name. Gopindra Jogi. Hahaha. So you can play the video like this. Now here are some attributes of the video tag. It is very simple to use the video tag. You should have a video. You have given the path of the video. After that, you have given the controls. So these controls will come to you. You can download it. You can do full screen. You can mute. You can do picture in picture. All this is automatically provided by your browser. But let me tell you about some attributes. The first attribute is SRC. So you know that put the video here. The name of the video file is SRC. This video file can also come from the external URL. You understand? That is, if I have uploaded a video on Amazon S3 or somewhere else. So I can also put the URL there. I mean, it is not necessary that the file is in your computer. It can also be on your server. It can also come from third party. Now what does the controls do? Adds video controls like play, pause and volume. Which we saw here in the Bhopendra Jogi video. That you are getting the controls here. Now what is this thing? The browser automatically checks what control ads will be in your video. What will not be. Then see what will autoplay do? It will automatically play as soon as the page loads. Okay? So if I put autoplay here. Suppose I put autoplay here. Okay? So see. So you can see here that it has been autoplayed. Okay? So I will remove autoplay from here. And our next attribute is loop. That is, once our video is played, it will keep looping. Like I show you. So it started again. Once I finished it, it started again. Okay? So this loop works like this. The next attribute is muted. Muted mutes the video. So if I write here muted. Sometimes we want the video to be muted. In fact, when I add videos here. On codewithhari.com. And I demonstrate something. Like downloading VS Code or something. So I use the muted attribute. Because I don't want when I record a video. If there is any background noise, you can hear it. For example, I want to show you that this is the element. So I will scroll and make a video. I will highlight it like this. So I don't need audio in it. So I mute it. So you can use the muted attribute on your website. Then poster. Poster is very important. So I have an image here. Download.jpg. Okay? If I write here poster is equal to. And I write download.jpg. So you see it will look something like this. Okay? This is how the poster looks. Then I will play. So the video will play. So in a way thumbnail. Okay? You saw the thumbnail of the YouTube video. This is exactly the same. This poster attribute. So you can use all these attributes. Width and height. You know that. Specify the dimension of the video. Like I added both width and height here. You saw. So I hope you understood this thing. Now the thing I want to tell you after this is audio. So this is for all the attributes of your video. It is very straightforward. I want you to make a website. Great. Which I am going to give you at the end of this video. In quick quiz. So listen to the quick quiz. In fact, I will put the heading here. Quick quiz from now on. Okay? So that I don't forget. I will give you this now. And this is going to be a very interesting quiz. And everyone must solve it. But before that. As soon as you write audio. Here comes SRC. And I have to put it in sachin.mp3. So as soon as I put it in sachin.mp3. Now see here. I will reload it. And there is no audio here. Which is strange. Let's see what the problem is here. I put SRC is equal to. I have to write controls here too. So if I don't write controls. Then I won't see the audio. See now the audio has come. I can see the controls here. I can also set its volume. I play this audio. What is Sachin in Sachin? Is it a stupid Sachin? Okay. So this is our audio. If I mute it and run it. Then it won't work. And I can also increase it further. Is it a stupid Sachin? Okay. You guys have seen. So this is audio named sachin.mp3. Now what we will do. That. We will see some attributes of this audio. SRC you know. That source. Video file. Okay. Then after this you know the controls. Play, pause or volume. Which we just saw. What will autoplay do? It will play it automatically. If I have here. Autoplay. What is Sachin in Sachin? Automatically played. Is it a stupid Sachin? So what does it do by autoplaying? Automatically played. Our audio. After this. The next attribute is. That is loop. What will loop do? It will repeat. If I want to loop it. Then I have autoplayed. Now I will loop. What is Sachin in Sachin? Is it a stupid Sachin? Once. What is Sachin in Sachin? Second time. Is it a stupid Sachin? So you saw it was repeated. Means once it was played. Then after that it was played again. Because I had looped the audio. Okay. So you guys have seen this thing. Sachin.mp3. I looped it. Means once it was played. Then it was played. Then it was played. What is Sachin? Sachin. Okay. She was saying again and again. Because this MP3. It will be played again and again. So there are many such cases. When you want. That this MP3 is repeat. Okay. So if you want. That your MP3 is repeat. Then you can use it. Now after this. What will mutate do? Will mute the audio. And definitely you don't want. That by default. Your audio is mute. In most of the cases. But. Sometimes we will want. That the audio is muted. And we can say here. To the user. That the audio is muted. And we can say here. That the audio is muted. And we can say here. To the user. That whoever wants to listen. Unmute it. Sachin what is it? When do we do this? When there are multiple audios. You want to show 5-6 audios together. You can mute them. The user can play. And see it unmuted. Okay. So. You have control in your hand. If you want. You can use this thing. Okay. In total this is the thing. So I hope. You have understood this thing. You must have enjoyed. Now preload. The most confusing attribute. And that's why. I have explained it on codewithaddy.com. That the preload attribute. It can have these values. So. The preload attribute. It can have these values. The first value can be none. This is the default value. It indicates. That the browser should not preload. The audio at all. Okay. Preload means. If you want. The browser to fetch the data. Then you will use the preload attribute. Otherwise you will not use the preload attribute. Okay. Preload is equal to none. It is the default value. Preload is equal to metadata. It means. That the browser. Only the metadata. That is. The information about that audio file. It will preload it. It will load it from the beginning. And by auto. You can. Preload. So. Preload is equal to auto. If I do. Then it will download. And automatically load. So that whenever the user plays it. So the audio is saved. Okay. So. This is the work of the preload attribute. And in interviews. This is the preload attribute. So you should know. What is the preload attribute. Before moving forward. I want you to share this playlist. With your friends. Because I am seeing. That the interest is declining a lot. As we are moving forward in the videos. My request to you. Share this playlist. With your friends. So that. The audience. Will get the benefit. And the audience. Will get the benefit. And the audience. Will get the benefit. So my request to you. Is that. You like this video. And along with that. As you are. Focusing on this repository. You should start it. Okay. Your star. Your likes. All this will help me a lot. To bring such free courses. So this was. About audio and video tags. Okay. I have told you all the attributes. Here. And you definitely. Use it. All the images. I will give you. So that you can try out. This thing. Now many people were asking. That can we use replit. See. In this course. I have not used replit. But replit.com is an amazing website. If you want. You can use it in your phone. If you want to run html. If you want to run html. There is a replit app. There is for iOS. There is for Android. So you can try it out. Many people are asking. How to do recording in the phone. Replit. But what I want now. VS code. Which most of the people. Want to use. Prefer. So I thought. Why not make videos in VS code. But I personally. Use replit a lot. Infact videos also come in replit. Next topic is. SV code. So I thought. Why not make videos in SV code. But I personally. Use replit a lot. Next topic is SVG. Media related. What is SVG. SVG is a format. With which you. Can create image. With high graphics. Vector images. So if you copy. You can make a circle. In this. So SVG is used. In the same way. As. Used. In our. IMG tag. So if I put SVG here. So this SVG will come here. So this circle and SVG. Came here. Video. Audio. SVG. These are inline elements. So we. Like it. So we. Like it. So we have. To see all. We are getting in line. Okay. You have seen here. Now what is here. That you can save. SVG file separately. You can save SVG file separately. Like if I write here. That. IMG dot SVG. And save the content of SVG in it. So if I write it by making IMG here. And write. IMG dot SVG. So you guys. Look here. That I did not see this. If I write alt here. And write. My SVG image. Then you. See here. image, so you can see here that my svg image is like this but i didn't get to see svg, why did this happen? this happened because the svg file in browser and whenever you want to see svg file in browser you will put a declaration above, i will show you so i wrote svg file not showing so here is an answer of stack overflow which will tell you so you have to write this, i will show you xml something like this, you have to add this this is called namespace declaration so you have to add svg here and now you can see svg here so this is very important and many people whenever you will make websites in future so they will get stuck in this problem i get stuck in this problem, so i am telling you that the problem in which you will get stuck i have already told you, you didn't get the problem i have told you the problem and solution next topic is iframes iframes is a very simple thing you can embed another website in your website like if i want to embed this webpage so i can use iframes like this so i wrote iframe this and i will copy this url and i will paste it here and you can see that this website is embedded in this iframe, you definitely want to embed in this big iframe but if you want to embed this so you can embed it like this i will increase the height so width is equal to width width is equal to let's say 122 height is equal to 444 ok, so this is how it looks like now definitely this width was coming so it came in this line but if i increase the width let's say i increase the width to 322 ok, so you can see that my website is completely embedded can you see so you can embed a website another use case of iframe is youtube video if you want to share youtube video and click on embed so it will give you iframe code and you can start it here if you want to start at a particular time so you can do that here the point at which you will start and share it, that time will come here let me show you let's say i want to start from here let's say video starts from here so what i will do is click on share after that i will click on embed start at 12.19 and i will copy it and i will put it in my code so let me comment this iframe and put it in the iframe below ok, i will do word wrap so that you can see the code properly so now what i will do is after pasting it i will show you the document see this video is embedded here so i hope you understood this and this is all in html miscellaneous in every topic you will see many things but pretty much that's all about media in html audio, video, media is all this is what you will use 95% of the times now i will give you a quick quiz and your quick quiz is create a website which shows videos of different category and audios of different categories you can use youtube videos in an iframe using youtube embedding feature so what you have to do is you have to create a website in which you will get a lot of content now you can use video audio tags and youtube share feature the way i have embedded youtube video you can also embed it in the same way and create a very good website and show it to me you can give me a comment and also you can tell me the code but do attempt this quiz and do write sigma batch opi in the comment section access this playlist like this video and do write sigma batch opi that's all for this video thank you so much for watching this video and i will see you next time music music"}
